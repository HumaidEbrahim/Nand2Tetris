# Nand2Tetris Part 1: Building a Computer from First Principles
This repository contains my implementations of key components from the Nand2Tetris Part 1 course, where I learned how to build a computer from the ground up using only NAND gates. https://www.nand2tetris.org/

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience with:

- **Boolean Logic & Digital Circuits** : Implemented fundamental logic gates (NOT, AND, OR, XOR) using only NAND gates.

- **Combinational Circuits** : Built multiplexers, demultiplexers, adders, ALUs, and other essential components.

- **Sequential Logic** : Designed flip-flops, registers, and memory units to enable stateful computation.

- **Machine Architecture** : Assembled a 16-bit CPU capable of executing machine instructions.

- **Low-Level Programming** : Learned the Hack Assembly language to write and execute programs on my custom-built CPU.

- **Assembler Implementation** : Developed an assembler in Python to translate Hack Assembly code into binary machine instructions.
